## Make a command that deletes the vehicle the player's ped is in


- You will have to create files and add them to fxmanifest.lua

## Natives that you could use
- [DeleteEntity()](https://docs.fivem.net/natives/?_0xFAA3D236)
- [DeleteVehicle()](https://docs.fivem.net/natives/?_0xEA386986E786A54F)
- [GetGamePool()](https://docs.fivem.net/natives/?_0x2B9D4F50) (this is if you want to do the bonus part about the nearby vehicle)

<hr/>

  
- Bonus points if the command is on the server side (better practice for security)
- Bonus points if it gets the vehicle in front of you if you're not in a vehicle
